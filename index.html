    - <a href="https://twitter.com/shawnshipley">I'm on Twitter</a>, but I don't tweet. I mainly follow some tech people to keep up on current trends.

  <p>
    - Technically I have a <a href="https://profiles.google.com/shawn.shipley/about">Google Profile</a> but you won't find much there yet.
  </p>
  <p>
    - I have a small <a href="https://github.com/shawnshipley">GitHub Repo</a>. Nothing major, just a place to keep a backup of my scripts and this blog. Feel free to clone this blog as a starting point for your own Jekyll powered blog.
